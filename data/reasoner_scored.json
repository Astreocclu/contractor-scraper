    "chain_of_thought": "We are scoring a lead for a luxury contractor marketplace. The lead is for a roof replacement. We need to consider the principles:\n\n1. Applicant Type: The owner name is \"SCOTT JAMES DAVID &\". This might be an individual homeowner (since it's a personal name with an ampersand, maybe a couple). But we need to check if it's a builder. The project description is \"roof replacement\", no indication of a builder. So likely homeowner. Not a production builder (which would be scored 0). So it's probably homeowner doing their own permit, which is gold.\n\n2. Freshness: Roof leads go stale in 2 weeks. This lead is 2 days old, so very fresh. That's good.\n\n3. Wealth: Market value is $342,990. This is less than $400k in DFW (Irving is in DFW area). According to principle 3: \"<$400k in DFW = price shopping, low margin.\" So this indicates a lower willingness to pay, likely price-sensitive.\n\n4. Absentee: is_absentee is false, so homeowner is present. That's good, not a landlord.\n\n5. Missing data: We have all data, no missing.\n\n6. Project description: \"roof replacement\" is specific, but not extremely detailed. It shows intent for roof work.\n\nNow, scoring: How quickly can a premium contractor monetize this lead? \n\nPositive factors:\n- Homeowner likely (active buyer)\n- Roof permit type (emergency purchase, but roof replacement might not be emergency, but still time-sensitive)\n- Very fresh (2 days old)\n- Not absentee\n\nNegative factors:\n- Low property value (<$400k) suggests price shopping, low margin. Premium contractor might have trouble monetizing because the homeowner may not be willing to pay for high-end work.\n\nGiven the principles, the wealth factor is important. For a luxury contractor, a homeowner with a lower property value might not be the ideal target. They may be more concerned with cost than quality.\n\nBut note: the lead is for roof replacement. Roof leads go stale quickly, so there is urgency. However, the low property value suggests the homeowner might not be a high-spending client.\n\nWe need to score 0-100. Calibration: 90+ call today, high close probability. This is not likely high close probability for a premium contractor because of price sensitivity. 70-89 strong lead, standard follow-up. Possibly in this range? But wealth is low. 50-69 worth working, needs qualification. That might be more appropriate.\n\nLet's consider the tier: A (80+), B (50-79), C (<50). \n\nI'd lean towards B, maybe around 60-70. But let's break it down:\n\n- Applicant type: homeowner, so good. Score maybe 80 on that aspect.\n- Freshness: 2 days old for roof, excellent. Score 90.\n- Wealth: low property value, score 30.\n- Absentee: false, good, score 80.\n- Project description: clear but not highly detailed, score 70.\n\nBut the principles say wealth = willingness to pay. So this is a major dampener. A premium contractor might have a harder time monetizing because the customer is likely to compare quotes and choose the cheaper option. So the score should reflect that.\n\nMaybe overall score around 55-65.\n\nAlso, the city is Irving, which is in DFW, so the property value is consistent with the area.\n\nFlags: Low property value might be a concern.\n\nIdeal contractor: Roofing contractor, but not necessarily luxury? The marketplace is for luxury contractors, but maybe a mid-range roofing contractor might be better. However, the prompt says \"premium contractor\". So we need to assess if a premium contractor can quickly monetize. Likely not, because the customer may not be willing to pay premium prices.\n\nContact priority: According to calibration, if score is 50-69, it's \"Worth working, needs qualification.\" So contact priority might be call or email? The prompt says \"call\" | \"email\" | \"skip\". For a roof lead that is fresh, calling is important because roof leads go stale fast. Even if the lead is not high wealth, it's still a potential sale. But maybe not the highest priority. Since it's fresh, call might be appropriate. However, if we score it in the 50-69 range, it might be more of an email? But the calibration says \"worth working, needs qualification\" so likely they would call to qualify. I think \"call\" is reasonable.\n\nLet's determine score more precisely.\n\nWe can think: For roof leads, freshness is critical. But wealth is also critical for premium contractors. So balance: Freshness gives it a boost, but low wealth brings it down.\n\nMaybe score: 65.\n\nTier: B.\n\nReasoning: The lead is a homeowner with a clear roof replacement need and is very fresh, but the low property value suggests price sensitivity, which may slow down monetization for a premium contractor.\n\nFlags: [\"Low property value for DFW area\"]\n\nIdeal contractor: Roofing contractor specializing in mid-range to premium roofs, but may need to offer competitive pricing.\n\nContact priority: call (since roof leads age quickly).\n\nBut let's see the output format: \"ideal_contractor\" should specify who should buy this lead from the buyers: Pool builders, patio contractors, roofers, fence companies. Obviously, roofers.\n\nSo: \"Roofer\"\n\nNow, final score: I'll go with 65.\n\nBut let's double-check: The owner name \"SCOTT JAMES DAVID &\" might be a business? The \"&\" could indicate a partnership or something. But it's likely an individual. Possibly a couple. Not clearly a builder. So we assume homeowner.\n\nMissing data: market value is given, not 0.\n\nSo, score: 65, tier B.\n\nReasoning: \"Homeowner with immediate roof replacement need (2 days old) indicates urgency, but property value under $400k suggests price sensitivity, requiring competitive quoting and potentially lower margins for a premium contractor.\"\n\nFlags: [\"Low property value relative to DFW market\"]\n\nIdeal contractor: \"Roofer\"\n\nContact priority: \"call\"\n\nI think that's reasonable.",

    "chain_of_thought": "We are given a lead to score for a luxury contractor lead marketplace. The buyers are pool builders, patio contractors, roofers, fence companies. The score is based on \"How quickly can a premium contractor monetize this lead?\" Principles are provided.\n\nLet's evaluate the given lead:\n\n{\n  \"project_description\": \"INSTALL SWIMMING POOL\",\n  \"permit_type\": \"Pool - Residential\",\n  \"owner_name\": \"DAVIS, KELLY\",\n  \"market_value\": 725603.0,\n  \"days_old\": 2,\n  \"is_absentee\": null,\n  \"city\": \"lewisville\"\n}\n\nStep-by-step analysis:\n\n1. APPLICANT TYPE MATTERS MOST:\n   - Owner name: \"DAVIS, KELLY\" looks like a person, likely homeowner. The project description is \"INSTALL SWIMMING POOL\". There is no indication of a builder or LLC. The permit type is \"Pool - Residential\". This suggests a homeowner doing their own permit, which is gold (active buyer). No red flags like \"Construction Corp\" in description. So applicant type is homeowner, which is best.\n\n2. FRESHNESS VARIES BY CATEGORY:\n   - This is a pool lead. According to principles: \"Pool leads stay warm for 2 months\". The lead is only 2 days old, so very fresh. That's excellent.\n\n3. WEALTH = WILLINGNESS TO PAY:\n   - Market value: $725,603. This falls in the range \"$500-750k = solid, will compare 2-3 quotes\". So it's solid, not the top tier (>$1M) but still good. The city is Lewisville, part of DFW? Possibly. The principle says \"<$400k in DFW = price shopping\", but this is >$700k, so not that.\n\n4. ABSENTEE IS CONTEXTUAL:\n   - is_absentee: null (missing data). According to principle: \"MISSING DATA = ASSUME THE WORST\". But absentee status is null, not necessarily missing? It says null, meaning unknown. For absentee, we don't know. However, the owner name is an individual, and market value is high, so likely not a landlord. But we should assume the worst? The principle says \"Unknown owner = can't contact\" but here owner name is known. For absentee, it's null, so we might assume it's not absentee? Actually, it says \"MISSING DATA = ASSUME THE WORST\". But is absentee missing? It's null, which could be interpreted as missing. But maybe we can infer from other data. Since market value is high, if absentee, it could be vacation home. But we don't know. I'd say this is a minor concern, but not a big red flag because the owner name is given and likely they live there.\n\n5. MISSING DATA = ASSUME THE WORST:\n   - We have owner name, market value, project description, etc. The only missing data is is_absentee. But we have enough to score. Market value is given, so we can assess wealth.\n\n6. PROJECT DESCRIPTION REVEALS TRUTH:\n   - \"INSTALL SWIMMING POOL\" is clear and specific. It indicates high intent for a pool. No builder names or vague address-only description.\n\nOverall, this is a strong lead for a pool builder. It's a homeowner with a solid property value, fresh lead, clear intent to install a pool.\n\nNow, scoring: We need to assign a score 0-100. Let's consider calibration.\n\nCalibration:\n- 90+: Call today, high close probability\n- 70-89: Strong lead, standard follow-up\n- 50-69: Worth working, needs qualification\n- 30-49: Low priority, batch outreach only\n- <30: Why did this pass the filter? Flag for review\n\nI'd put this lead in the 80+ range. It's a pool lead, homeowner, good property value, very fresh. It might not be a 90+ because property value is not over $1M, so they might compare quotes, but still a strong lead.\n\nLet's break down:\n\nApplicant type: homeowner = gold -> high score.\nFreshness: 2 days old for pool -> very fresh -> high score.\nWealth: $725k -> solid, but not top tier -> medium-high.\nAbsentee: unknown, but assume worst? Actually, since it's null, we might assume it's not absentee? But principle says assume worst, so maybe assume it's absentee? However, absentee + high value = vacation home, wealthy, so that might not be bad. But absentee + low value = landlord. Here value is high, so if absentee, it's still good. So not a big penalty.\nProject description: clear and specific -> high intent.\n\nI think this is a strong lead, likely an A tier (80+). I'll score around 85.\n\nTier: A (since 80+)\nReasoning: Homeowner with clear pool installation intent, high property value, and very fresh lead make this highly monetizable.\nFlags: None major, but absentee status unknown.\nIdeal contractor: Pool builder (specialized in luxury pools).\nContact priority: call (since it's fresh and high intent).\n\nWait, contact priority: According to calibration, 90+ is call today, 70-89 is strong lead, standard follow-up. So maybe \"call\" is appropriate for high priority? But the output format says contact_priority: \"call\" | \"email\" | \"skip\". For 85, it's strong lead, so likely call is still appropriate, but maybe not as urgent as 90+. But I think \"call\" is fine, as it's a high-quality lead for a pool builder.\n\nLet's decide on score: 85.\n\nReasoning: \"Homeowner with a clear pool installation project, solid property value indicating ability to pay, and lead is only 2 days old. This is a high-intent lead for a luxury pool builder.\"\n\nFlags: Could list \"absentee status unknown\" but that's minor. Maybe no flags? I'll list if any concerns: none.\n\nIdeal contractor: \"Luxury pool builder\"\n\nContact priority: \"call\"\n\nNow, output in JSON format.",

Although the homeowner has a specific need and the lead is fresh, the low property value suggests price sensitivity and low margin.",
    "chain_of_thought": "We need to score this lead based on the given principles. Let's break down the lead details:\n\n- project_description: \"REPLACE HVAC SYSTEM AND FULL DUCT REPLACEMENT\"\n- permit_type: \"Mechanical HVAC - Residential\"\n- owner_name: \"FAIRES, CASEY\"\n- market_value: 304509.0\n- days_old: 2\n- is_absentee: null (so unknown)\n- city: \"lewisville\"\n\nNow, step by step:\n\n1. **Applicant Type**: The owner is an individual (FAIRES, CASEY), and the permit is for residential HVAC replacement. There's no indication that it's a builder or LLC. The project description sounds like a homeowner replacing their HVAC system. So likely a homeowner doing their own permit. That's gold according to principle 1 (active buyer). However, check if there's any hint of builder: project_description doesn't have \"Construction Corp\" or anything. So it's a homeowner.\n\n2. **Freshness**: Days old = 2, very fresh. But freshness varies by category. This is an HVAC lead. HVAC is not explicitly listed in the categories, but it's similar to roofing? Actually, HVAC might be considered an emergency purchase? The principles mention roof leads go stale in 2 weeks, pool leads 2 months, everything else 30 days. HVAC is probably in \"everything else\". So 2 days old is very fresh.\n\n3. **Wealth**: Market value = $304,509. According to principle 3, <$400k in DFW = price shopping, low margin. The city is Lewisville, which is in the Dallas-Fort Worth area (DFW). So property value is below $400k, indicating the homeowner is likely price-sensitive, will shop around, low margin. That's a negative.\n\n4. **Absentee**: is_absentee is null (unknown). Principle 5 says missing data = assume the worst. So we should assume worst: possibly absentee? But absentee is contextual. Since market value is low, if absentee, it might be a landlord choosing cheapest. But it's null, so we might flag as unknown, but assume worst? Possibly treat as non-absentee? Actually principle says \"Missing data = assume the worst\". So for absentee, if unknown, assume it's absentee? But worst for monetization? Absentee with low value = landlord, will choose cheapest. That could be worse than owner-occupied. So we might assume it's absentee. However, owner name looks like an individual, so maybe not. But to be safe, we'll consider it a concern.\n\n5. **Missing Data**: Only absentee is null, otherwise we have market value, owner name, etc. Market value is given, not $0. So we can assess wealth.\n\n6. **Project Description**: \"REPLACE HVAC SYSTEM AND FULL DUCT REPLACEMENT\" \u2013 this is specific and high intent. It's not vague. So good.\n\nNow, putting it together: This is a homeowner (good), with a specific HVAC replacement project (good intent), very fresh (2 days). However, property value is low (<$400k) so likely price-sensitive, low margin. Absentee unknown \u2013 assume worst? Possibly landlord.\n\nBut also note: the buyers in the marketplace are pool builders, patio contractors, roofers, fence companies. HVAC is not directly listed. But maybe roofers sometimes do HVAC? Actually not typically. So which contractor would monetize this lead? It's an HVAC lead, so perhaps not directly applicable. But the marketplace is for luxury contractors, and HVAC might be considered a trade that could be cross-sold? However, the principles don't mention HVAC. But since we have to score based on \"how quickly can a premium contractor monetize this lead?\", we need to consider if any of the listed contractors (pool, patio, roof, fence) would be interested. Probably not directly. Unless there is a cross-selling opportunity? For example, a roofer might also do HVAC? Not typically. Maybe the marketplace also includes HVAC contractors? But the prompt says \"luxury contractor lead marketplace\" and lists those four types. So likely this lead is not for those trades. However, the permit type is HVAC, so it might be a lead for an HVAC contractor. Perhaps the marketplace is broader? The prompt says \"Pool builders, patio contractors, roofers, fence companies\" are the buyers. So if the lead is for HVAC, it might not be relevant. But maybe we need to score it anyway based on principles. Possibly it should be scored low because it's not a fit? But the principles don't say to score 0 if not in those categories. They say production builder in project_description = trash. So we need to assess based on the given principles, but also note that the ideal contractor might be an HVAC contractor, but if the marketplace only has those four, then this lead might not be valuable. However, the prompt says \"luxury contractor lead marketplace\" and the buyers are those four, but the lead is for HVAC. Perhaps we should consider if any of those contractors would be interested in HVAC? Unlikely. So the score might be low because it's not a good match for the available contractors. But the principles are given, and we are to score based on how quickly a premium contractor can monetize it. If there's no premium contractor in that trade, monetization is slow. So that should factor in.\n\nMaybe we should treat HVAC as similar to roofing in terms of freshness? Roof leads go stale in 2 weeks because emergency purchase. HVAC replacement might also be somewhat urgent if the system is broken. So freshness might be similar. But still, the contractors available may not be HVAC specialists.\n\nLet's read the prompt carefully: \"YOUR BUYERS: Pool builders, patio contractors, roofers, fence companies\" so they are the ones buying leads. So a lead for HVAC is not directly relevant. However, sometimes roofers might also offer attic insulation or something, but not full HVAC replacement. So likely this lead is not ideal. But we have to score it.\n\nPerhaps we need to consider cross-selling: principle 1 says custom/boutique builder = okay (cross-sell other trades). But this is a homeowner, not a builder. So cross-selling other trades might be possible if the homeowner is doing a larger renovation? But the project is only HVAC and duct replacement, which is standalone. Possibly not.\n\nGiven the principles, we should score based on the factors, but also consider that the lead might not be a good fit for the marketplace. The score should reflect how quickly a premium contractor (from the listed trades) can monetize it. Since it's not their trade, they would need to refer it or maybe they have partnerships? But that would slow monetization. So likely low score.\n\nBut let's see: could a roofer monetize this lead? Possibly if they also do HVAC? Some full-service home performance contractors might do both, but it's not common. So likely no.\n\nThus, the score should be low. However, the principles don't give explicit guidance on mismatched trade. But we can infer: if the lead is not for one of the contractor types, it's not monetizable quickly. So score low.\n\nBut let's compute a score based on the principles anyway:\n\n- Applicant type: Homeowner = gold. That's a positive.\n- Freshness: 2 days old, very fresh. Positive.\n- Wealth: $304,509, low value, price shopping. Negative.\n- Absentee: null, assume worst (landlord). Negative.\n- Project description: specific, high intent. Positive.\n- Missing data: only absentee missing, otherwise okay.\n\nIf we were scoring for an HVAC contractor, this might be a decent lead: homeowner, specific need, fresh. But property value low, so maybe not luxury. But for a premium HVAC contractor, they might still get the job but at lower margin. However, our buyers are not HVAC contractors. So the monetization for our buyers is zero unless they can resell the lead or something. But that's not typical.\n\nGiven the calibration: <30 is \"Why did this pass the filter? Flag for review\". This lead is for HVAC, which is not one of the listed trades, so it might have slipped through the filter. So score should be <30.\n\nBut let's see if there's any possibility: sometimes patio contractors might do outdoor kitchens which could include HVAC? No. Pool builders might need HVAC for pool houses? Unlikely. So probably not.\n\nThus, I think the score should be low, maybe 20-30.\n\nBut let's be more precise: We'll assign points based on factors:\n\nApplicant type: Homeowner = 25 points (out of 100? Not exactly). But we can think in tiers.\n\nPerhaps we can score as if it were for the correct trade, then adjust for trade mismatch.\n\nIf this were a roofing lead, with these attributes:\n- Homeowner: +30\n- Freshness 2 days: +20 (since roof leads go stale in 2 weeks, 2 days is excellent)\n- Wealth low: -20\n- Absentee unknown (assume worst): -10\n- Specific description: +10\nTotal: 30? That's low.\n\nBut for roofing, low wealth is a big negative. So maybe 30-40.\n\nBut for HVAC, it might be similar. However, since it's not roofing, we should use \"everything else\" freshness: 30 days is the line, so 2 days is still very fresh. But the urgency might be less than roofing, so maybe +15 for freshness.\n\nAnyway, let's not overcomplicate. We'll output a score with reasoning.\n\nI think the score should be low because:\n1. The lead is for HVAC, which is not a trade served by the marketplace's premium contractors.\n2. Even if it were, the property value is low, indicating price sensitivity and low margin.\n3. Absentee status unknown, assume worst-case landlord.\n\nSo score: 25? Tier C.\n\nContact priority: skip, because it's not relevant.\n\nIdeal contractor: HVAC contractor, but not in the marketplace.\n\nFlags: [\"Mismatched trade: HVAC\", \"Low property value\", \"Absentee unknown\"]\n\nReasoning: The lead is for HVAC work, which is not a service offered by the marketplace's contractors, making monetization unlikely. Additionally, the low property value suggests price sensitivity, and unknown absentee status may indicate a landlord seeking the lowest bid.\n\nLet's format output.\n\nBut note: the output format includes \"ideal_contractor\". Since our buyers are pool, patio, roof, fence, none are ideal. But maybe we can say \"HVAC contractor\" or \"Not applicable to current buyers\". But the prompt says \"who should buy this lead\", meaning among the buyers? Possibly we can say \"None\" or \"Specialty HVAC contractor\". I'll put \"HVAC contractor (not typical for marketplace)\".\n\nContact priority: \"skip\" because it's not a fit.\n\nScore: I'll give 20.\n\nTier: \"C\"\n\nFlags: [\"Mismatched trade\", \"Low property value\", \"Absentee unknown\"]\n\nReasoning: \"Homeowner with specific HVAC need, but low property value indicates price sensitivity. The lead is not aligned with the marketplace's contractor types (pool, patio, roof, fence), making immediate monetization difficult.\"\n\nLet's see if any of the principles directly address trade mismatch? Principle 1 mentions production builder = trash. But not trade mismatch. So we have to use judgment.\n\nPerhaps the marketplace also includes HVAC contractors? The prompt says \"luxury contractor lead marketplace\" and lists those four as examples, but maybe it's not exhaustive? It says \"YOUR BUYERS: Pool builders, patio contractors, roofers, fence companies\" so it's specific. So likely HVAC is not included.\n\nThus, final answer.",

    "chain_of_thought": "We are scoring this lead for a luxury contractor lead marketplace. Buyers are pool builders, patio contractors, roofers, fence companies. Customers are homeowners with money who want quality work. We need to score based on \"How quickly can a premium contractor monetize this lead?\" using the principles.\n\nLead details:\n- project_description: \"NEW SFD. build my custom home in Irving.\"\n- permit_type: \"New Construction\"\n- owner_name: \"SHITTU, FOLASADE\"\n- market_value: 383228.0\n- days_old: 3\n- is_absentee: false\n- city: \"irving\"\n\nLet's analyze step by step:\n\n1. APPLICANT TYPE MATTERS MOST:\n   - The project description says \"NEW SFD. build my custom home in Irving.\" This indicates it's for building a new single-family dwelling (custom home). The owner name is an individual name: \"SHITTU, FOLASADE\". However, note principle #6: \"Owner name looks personal but project_description has 'Construction Corp' = BUILDER\". Here, there's no \"Construction Corp\" in the description; it says \"build my custom home\", which suggests it's the homeowner building their own custom home. But wait: permit_type is \"New Construction\". This could be a custom home build. The applicant type seems to be a homeowner doing their own permit? Possibly, but \"build my custom home\" might indicate the homeowner is acting as the builder or hiring a custom builder. We need to check if it's a production builder. The description doesn't mention a production builder name. It says \"custom home\", so likely it's a custom/boutique builder or the homeowner themselves. Principle says: \"Homeowner doing their own permit = gold (active buyer)\". But is this a homeowner doing their own permit? The owner name is an individual, and the permit type is New Construction. Often, for new construction, the permit applicant might be the builder, not the homeowner. However, the project description says \"build my custom home\", which suggests the homeowner is involved. Possibly it's a custom home for the homeowner. But also, principle says \"Production builder in project_description = trash\". There is no production builder mentioned. So it's not trash. It could be a custom/boutique builder, which is \"okay (cross-sell other trades)\". But wait: the owner_name is an individual, not a company. Sometimes the owner is the homeowner, but the builder might be separate. Without more info, we should look at other factors. Possibly this is a homeowner acting as their own builder (owner-builder). That would be gold. But the market value is only $383,228, which for a new custom home in Irving, TX seems low. Irving is in the Dallas-Fort Worth area. According to principle #3: \"<$400k in DFW = price shopping, low margin\". So that's a red flag. Also, principle #5: Missing data = assume the worst. Here we have data, but some ambiguity.\n\n2. FRESHNESS: days_old is 3, which is very fresh. Freshness varies by category, but we don't know the specific trade. The lead is for new construction, which could involve multiple trades (pool, patio, roof, fence). But the lead is a new construction permit, so contractors could be interested in doing the roofing, or maybe a pool if the homeowner plans one, but it's not specified. Since it's new construction, there might be opportunities for roofing (new roof), fencing, patio, etc. But the project description is about building a custom home, so it's early stage. Freshness: For roof leads, they go stale in 2 weeks; for pool leads, 2 months; everything else 30 days. This lead is 3 days old, so very fresh regardless.\n\n3. WEALTH: market_value is $383,228. According to principle #3: \"<$400k in DFW = price shopping, low margin\". Irving is in DFW. So this property value is in the low margin category. The homeowner is likely to be price-sensitive, not the luxury customer who pays for quality without haggling. This suggests low willingness to pay for premium contractors.\n\n4. ABSENTEE: is_absentee is false, so owner is likely living there or intends to live there. That's good for custom work because they care about quality. But with low property value, they might still be cost-conscious.\n\n5. MISSING DATA: We have all data fields, nothing missing. But the project description is somewhat vague: \"NEW SFD. build my custom home in Irving.\" It gives intent but not specifics about which trades are needed. So we have to infer that for a new construction, multiple trades will be needed. However, the lead is for the new construction permit itself, not for a specific trade like roof or pool. For a luxury contractor marketplace, they might be interested in specific trades. But the lead could be sold to a general contractor or to trade-specific contractors who want to get in early. However, the principles are geared towards scoring leads for specific trades? The buyers are pool builders, patio contractors, roofers, fence companies. So they want leads that are likely to need their specific services. This lead is for new construction, so it could be relevant for all of them, but it's not targeted. The marketplace might categorize leads by trade. Here, the permit type is \"New Construction\", not a specific trade. It might be a lead for the whole project. But for a premium contractor, they might want leads where the homeowner is actively seeking a specific service. This lead is about building a house, so the homeowner might be hiring a general contractor or acting as their own. For trade-specific contractors, they would need to be brought in by the GC or homeowner. So it's less direct.\n\n6. PROJECT DESCRIPTION REVEALS TRUTH: The description says \"build my custom home\". That indicates intent for a custom home, not a production build. The owner name is personal, so likely the homeowner. But the market value is low for a custom home in DFW. Possibly it's a modest custom home. Or maybe the market value is the land value? For new construction, the market value might be the land value before construction. That could explain the low number. But we don't know. Principle says assume the worst if data is missing or unclear. Here, the market value is given as $383,228, which we take at face value.\n\nNow, scoring: We need to score 0-100 based on how quickly a premium contractor can monetize this lead.\n\nGiven the low property value, this homeowner is likely price-sensitive. They might not be the ideal customer for luxury contractors who charge premium prices. Also, the lead is for new construction, which could involve many decisions, but the contractor would need to qualify the homeowner's budget and timeline. Since it's a custom home build, the homeowner might be open to premium products, but the low property value suggests otherwise.\n\nAlso, consider the applicant type: It appears to be a homeowner (individual name) building a custom home. That could be good, but with the low property value, it might be a modest custom home. Possibly it's a production builder disguised? But the description says \"custom home\", so likely not.\n\nFreshness is good (3 days old).\n\nAbsentee false is good.\n\nOverall, this lead might not be a high-priority for premium contractors because the homeowner likely has a limited budget. However, for some trades like roofing, if the new construction requires a roof, that's a necessity, but they might choose a lower-cost roofer. For pool builders, a new construction might include a pool if the homeowner wants one, but with a low property value, they might not opt for a luxury pool.\n\nGiven principle #3: \"<$400k in DFW = price shopping, low margin\", we should score this lower.\n\nLet's think about tiers: \n- A: 80+ (call today, high close probability)\n- B: 50-79 (strong lead, standard follow-up or worth working)\n- C: <50 (low priority, batch outreach only)\n\nI'd put this in the C tier, maybe around 30-49.\n\nBut let's not forget that it's a new construction custom home, which could have potential for multiple trades. However, the low market value is a major concern.\n\nAlso, note that the city is Irving, which is in DFW, so the property value context applies.\n\nIdeal contractor: Who should buy this lead? Possibly a roofer, because every new home needs a roof. But also fence companies (new homes often need fencing) and patio contractors (for outdoor living). Pool builders might be less likely because the homeowner may not have budget for a pool. But it's a custom home, so maybe they plan for a pool. The project description doesn't mention pool, so it's uncertain.\n\nContact priority: Based on score, if it's low, it might be batch outreach only.\n\nLet's compute a score. We'll consider factors:\n\n- Applicant type: Homeowner building custom home. This is somewhat positive, but not the \"gold\" of homeowner doing their own permit (here the permit is new construction, so maybe the homeowner is the permit puller? Possibly, but not sure). I'd rate this as \"okay\" like custom/boutique builder. Score impact: moderate.\n- Freshness: 3 days old, very fresh. Positive.\n- Wealth: $383k in DFW, negative.\n- Absentee: false, positive.\n- Project description: somewhat vague but indicates custom home, positive intent.\n- Missing data: none.\n\nOverall, the biggest negative is the low property value, which suggests price sensitivity.\n\nAlso, the lead is for new construction, which is a longer sales cycle and might not be immediately monetizable for a specific trade contractor. They would need to get in touch with the homeowner or GC at the right time.\n\nSo I'd score it around 40.\n\nLet's be precise: \nIf property value was >$1M, it would be high score. Here it's <$400k, so low score.\nIf it were a homeowner doing their own permit, that's gold, but here permit type is New Construction, which might be pulled by a builder. The owner name is an individual, so it could be owner-builder. But the description says \"build my custom home\", which might mean the homeowner is hiring a builder. So it's not clear if the homeowner is directly purchasing trade services.\n\nGiven the ambiguity and low property value, I'll score it 35.\n\nTier: C (since <50)\n\nReasoning: \"Low property value suggests price-sensitive homeowner; new construction custom home has potential but likely low margin for premium contractors. Freshness is good but monetization may be slower due to project complexity.\"\n\nFlags: [\"Low property value for DFW\", \"New construction may involve GC, not direct homeowner trade purchase\", \"Vague project description\"]\n\nIdeal contractor: \"General contractor or roofer may have early opportunity, but budget constraints likely.\"\n\nContact priority: Based on score <30? Actually score is 35, which is in 30-49 range: \"Low priority, batch outreach only\". So contact priority should be \"email\" or \"skip\"? The calibration says for 30-49: \"Low priority, batch outreach only\". So perhaps \"email\" as batch outreach, not immediate call. I'll set contact_priority: \"email\".\n\nBut let's see output format: contact_priority is \"call\" | \"email\" | \"skip\". So for low priority, likely \"email\".\n\nSo final output.",

APPLICANT TYPE MATTERS MOST: \n   - The project_description says \"Construction of new single family home.\" and permit_type is \"New Construction\". The owner_name is \"CIMO JOSEPH C & JILLIAN W\". This looks like a personal name, but the project description indicates it's for new construction. According to principles: \"Owner name looks personal but project_description has 'Construction Corp' = BUILDER\". Here it doesn't say \"Construction Corp\", but it says \"Construction of new single family home.\" This could be a custom/boutique builder or a homeowner building their own home? But note: \"Homeowner doing their own permit = gold (active buyer)\". However, this is a new construction permit. The owner is likely the future homeowner, but they might be acting as their own contractor? Or it could be a builder. The principle also says: \"Production builder in project_description = trash (should be filtered, score 0 if you see one)\". But here it doesn't explicitly say a production builder name. It just says \"Construction of new single family home.\" So we need to infer. The owner name is personal, so it might be a custom build. But wait: The market_value is $400,000. That's relatively low for a new construction home? Possibly a spec home? Also, is_absentee = true. That might indicate it's an investment property or the owners don't live there. Could be a builder/developer. Given the principles, we should check if this is a production builder. There's no company name, but the absentee status and new construction might indicate it's an investor or builder. The principle says: \"Custom/boutique builder = okay (cross-sell other trades)\". But also \"LLC/investor = depends on property value\". The owner name is personal, not an LLC. So maybe it's an individual building a home for themselves? But they are absentee? That could be a vacation home or they are building while living elsewhere. But with a $400k property value in Irving, TX (DFW area), that's on the lower end. According to principle 3: \"<$400k in DFW = price shopping, low margin\". So this property value is exactly $400k, which is borderline. But principle says \"<$400k in DFW = price shopping, low margin\". $400k is not less than $400k, it's equal. But likely it's considered low end. Probably it's in the lower tier.\n\n   Let's see: \"Production builder in project_description = trash\". There is no explicit production builder name, but \"Construction of new single family home\" is generic. It could be a production builder. However, the owner name is personal, so maybe it's a custom build. But with absentee and low value, it might be an investor building a spec home. I'd lean towards it being an investor or small builder. But the principle says: if it's a production builder, score 0. We need to be careful. Possibly it's not a production builder because the owner name is individuals. Production builders usually have company names. So we'll assume it's not a production builder. But we need to decide applicant type: It could be \"Homeowner doing their own permit\" if they are acting as their own contractor. Or it could be \"Custom/boutique builder\" if they are building for sale. Or \"LLC/investor\". The name is not an LLC, but individuals can be investors. Given is_absentee = true, they likely don't live there. So they are probably building as an investment. So applicant type: likely investor.\n\n2. FRESHNESS: days_old = 3. That's very fresh. But freshness varies by category. What category is this? The permit is \"New Construction\". That could involve multiple trades: roofing, fencing, patio? But it's a whole house build. For a premium contractor, they might be interested in specific trades like roofing, fencing, or maybe a pool? But the project is new construction, so all trades are needed. However, the lead marketplace is for luxury contractors focusing on homeowners with money. This lead is for new construction, which might be more suited to general contractors or subcontractors. But the buyers are pool builders, patio contractors, roofers, fence companies. They might be interested in providing their specific trade for this new home. So it could be a cross-selling opportunity. But the principle says: \"Custom/boutique builder = okay (cross-sell other trades)\". So if it's a custom builder, it's okay. If it's an investor, it depends on property value.\n\n   Freshness: Since it's new construction, the timeline might be longer. But for roofing, it might be needed soon. Roof leads go stale in 2 weeks. This is 3 days old, so very fresh. For pool leads, they stay warm for 2 months. But this is not specifically a pool project. So we need to consider the overall freshness. Since it's fresh, it's a positive.\n\n3. WEALTH: market_value = $400,000. City is Irving (part of DFW). According to principle 3: \"<$400k in DFW = price shopping, low margin\". This is exactly $400k. It might be considered in the lower tier. Probably not a luxury homeowner. So willingness to pay for quality is low. They will likely price shop. So wealth is low.\n\n4. ABSENTEE: is_absentee = true. Context: absentee + high value = vacation home, wealthy. But here value is low ($400k). So absentee + low value = landlord, will choose cheapest. So this is a negative. They are likely an investor looking to rent or flip, so they will want low cost.\n\n5. MISSING DATA: We have most data. No missing owner name, market value is given, project description is given. So no major missing data.\n\n6. PROJECT DESCRIPTION REVEALS TRUTH: \"Construction of new single family home.\" This is vague in terms of specific trades. It doesn't say \"custom pools\" or anything specific. So unclear intent for any particular trade. The owner name looks personal, but the project description doesn't contradict that. However, with new construction, there might be opportunities for multiple trades, but the lead is not specifically for a luxury upgrade; it's for the whole house. The contractors in our marketplace are luxury focused, so they might not be interested in a low-budget new construction.\n\nOverall assessment: This lead is for new construction with a relatively low property value ($400k) in DFW, absentee owner (likely investor), fresh (3 days old). The applicant type is likely investor/landlord, not a homeowner living there. For luxury contractors, this lead is probably low priority because the client is price-sensitive and not likely to pay for premium quality. Also, the project is generic new construction, so the contractor would need to compete on price.\n\nScore calibration: We need to assign a score 0-100.\n\nLet's consider the ideal contractor: Who should buy this lead? Possibly a roofer, since roofing is needed in new construction and roof leads go stale quickly. But the roofer would be dealing with an investor who likely wants the cheapest option. So it might not be a good fit for a premium roofer. Similarly, fence company might be needed, but again, price sensitivity.\n\nMaybe the lead is better for a standard contractor, not luxury. Since our marketplace is for luxury contractors, this lead might not be ideal.\n\nWe need to decide a score. Let's think of tiers:\n- A (80+): High close probability, premium client.\n- B (50-79): Solid lead, needs some work.\n- C (<50): Low priority.\n\nGiven the low property value and absentee investor, this is likely a price shopper. Also, new construction might have multiple bidders, driving margins down. So score should be on the lower side.\n\nBut it's fresh, and it's a new construction, so there is definite need. However, the principle says for production builder score 0. We determined it's not clearly a production builder, but it might be similar. Possibly it's a small-scale investor building a spec home.\n\nI'd score it low, maybe in the 30-49 range? Let's break down:\n\nApplicant type: Investor (absentee, low value) -> negative.\nWealth: Low (borderline $400k) -> negative.\nFreshness: Positive (3 days) -> positive.\nProject description: Vague, not specific to luxury -> neutral/negative.\nAbsentee + low value -> landlord, chooses cheapest -> negative.\n\nOverall, it's a lead that might be monetized but with low margin and low close probability for a premium contractor. The contractor would need to compete on price, so not ideal.\n\nScore estimate: I'd say around 40.\n\nBut let's check the calibration: 30-49 is \"Low priority, batch outreach only\". That seems appropriate.\n\nNow, flags: Concerns: Low property value, absentee owner (likely investor), generic new construction project (not specific luxury intent).\n\nIdeal contractor: Possibly a roofer or fence company that caters to investors/new construction, but not necessarily luxury. Since our buyers are premium contractors, maybe they wouldn't want this. But we have to suggest who among them might be best. Roofers might benefit because roof leads are time-sensitive, but again, it's new construction so the timeline might be aligned with construction schedule. Possibly a fence company? But fences are usually installed later. I'd say the ideal contractor might be a roofer, since roofing is needed early in construction and the lead is fresh. But they should be aware it's a price-sensitive client.\n\nContact priority: Given low score, likely \"email\" or \"skip\". According to calibration, <30 should be flagged for review. We have >30, so batch outreach. Contact priority: \"email\" might be appropriate for batch outreach.\n\nLet's decide: score 40, tier C, reasoning: \"Low property value and absentee owner indicate a price-sensitive investor building a spec home. While the lead is fresh, premium contractors will face tight margins and high competition.\" Flags: [\"Low property value\", \"Absentee investor\", \"Generic new construction\"] Ideal contractor: \"Roofer (due to urgency) or fence company (for later phase), but must be prepared for price competition.\" Contact priority: \"email\" (batch outreach).\n\nBut wait, the principle says: \"Production builder in project_description = trash (should be filtered, score 0 if you see one)\". Is this a production builder? The description doesn't name a builder, but \"Construction of new single family home\" could be from a production builder. However, the owner name is personal. Sometimes production builders pull permits under the homeowner's name if it's a custom build? Possibly it's a custom home for the owners. But absentee suggests they don't live there, so maybe they are building to sell. It's ambiguous.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, I'll not score 0. I'll assume it's not a production builder.\n\nLet's calculate a more precise score. We can assign points:\n\n- Applicant type: Investor (not homeowner) -> score around 30? \n- Wealth: $400k in DFW -> low -> score 30.\n- Freshness: 3 days -> very fresh -> +20 points? But freshness doesn't directly add, it affects how quickly it can be monetized. Fresh is good.\n- Absentee: low value -> negative -> -10.\n- Project description: vague -> neutral.\n- Overall: Maybe 40-50.\n\nI'll go with 45.\n\nTier: C (since <50)\n\nReasoning: \"This new construction lead is from an absentee owner with a $400k property value, indicating a price-sensitive investor rather than a luxury homeowner. While the lead is fresh, premium contractors will likely face low margins and high competition.\"\n\nFlags: [\"Low property value for DFW\", \"Absentee owner (likely investor)\", \"Generic project description\"]\n\nIdeal contractor: \"A roofer may capitalize on the urgency of new construction timelines, but must be prepared to compete on price.\"\n\nContact priority: \"email\" (for batch outreach)\n\nLet's produce the output.",

Their customers are homeowners with money who want quality work.

Irving is in Texas, part of Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex, so likely DFW)\n\nPrinciples:\n1. Applicant type: owner_name looks personal, so likely homeowner doing their own permit. That's gold (active buyer). But we need to check if there's any indication of builder in project_description. Project description is \"replace 3-ton hvac system\", which is specific and seems like a homeowner-initiated repair/replacement. No mention of \"Construction Corp\" etc. So likely homeowner. Good.\n\n2. Freshness: This is an HVAC lead. But our buyers are pool, patio, roof, fence. HVAC is not one of our categories? Wait, the lead is for an HVAC system replacement. But our marketplace is for luxury contractors in specific trades: pool builders, patio contractors, roofers, fence companies. This lead is for HVAC, which is not one of the trades we serve. However, the permit type is \"Mechanical Standalone\" which is typically for HVAC. So this lead might not be relevant to our buyers at all. But the instruction says we are scoring leads for a luxury contractor lead marketplace with those specific buyers. So if the lead is not in one of those categories, it should likely be filtered out or scored low. But the principles don't explicitly say to filter out non-matching trades. But the scoring is based on how quickly a premium contractor (from our pool of buyers) can monetize it. If the lead is for HVAC, none of our contractors do HVAC. So they cannot monetize it. Therefore, the score should be 0 or very low. However, maybe we should consider if any of our buyers might cross-sell? Unlikely. Roofers might sometimes do HVAC? No, not typically. So this lead is out of scope.\n\nBut let's read the principles carefully: \"THEIR CUSTOMERS: Homeowners with money who want quality work\" and \"YOUR BUYERS: Pool builders, patio contractors, roofers, fence companies\". So the lead should be for a project in one of those categories. This lead is for HVAC replacement, so not relevant.\n\nHowever, the scoring prompt says \"Score this lead:\" and provides the data. Possibly we are expected to score it based on general principles, and maybe some of our buyers might be interested in HVAC? But that's not listed. Alternatively, maybe the lead marketplace includes contractors beyond those four? But the instruction specifies only those buyers.\n\nGiven the context, I think we need to score it as if it were for one of our trades. But the project_description clearly says \"replace 3-ton hvac system\". That is not a pool, patio, roof, or fence project. So perhaps this lead should be filtered out. Principle 1 mentions \"Production builder in project_description = trash (should be filtered, score 0 if you see one)\". So maybe we apply a similar logic: if the project is not within our scope, score 0? But the instruction doesn't say that explicitly. However, the scoring is for \"a premium contractor\" from our list, so if none of them can monetize it, the score should be 0.\n\nBut let's see the output format: it includes \"ideal_contractor\": \"who should buy this lead\". That implies we need to suggest which type of contractor should buy it. If it's HVAC, maybe we say \"HVAC contractor\" but our buyers don't include that. Possibly we have to assign it to the closest match? None.\n\nMaybe I'm overthinking. Perhaps the lead is for a mechanical permit, but maybe it could be for a pool heater or something? \"replace 3-ton hvac system\" is clearly a central air conditioning system. Not relevant.\n\nGiven the principles, we should score based on the factors, but if the project is not something our contractors do, then monetization speed is zero. So score 0.\n\nBut let's check the calibration: \"<30: Why did this pass the filter? Flag for review\". So if we score it low, we should flag for review.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the lead marketplace also includes HVAC contractors? The instruction says \"YOUR BUYERS: Pool builders, patio contractors, roofers, fence companies\". So only those. So this lead is not for them.\n\nTherefore, I will score it 0.\n\nBut wait, maybe the permit type \"Mechanical Standalone\" could include pool equipment? Possibly, but \"replace 3-ton hvac system\" specifically says HVAC, which is heating, ventilation, air conditioning. Not typically pool-related.\n\nI think score 0 is appropriate.\n\nLet's go through the principles anyway:\n\n1. Applicant type: Homeowner doing their own permit? Owner name is personal, permit is mechanical. Likely homeowner. That's good, but not for our trades.\n\n2. Freshness: 3 days old. For HVAC, if it were a roofer? Not applicable. But if we consider it as a general lead, HVAC leads might be urgent (like roof leaks?) but not exactly. Principle says roof leads go stale in 2 weeks (emergency). HVAC might also be emergency in extreme weather, but not specified.\n\n3. Wealth: Market value $257,520, which is less than $400k in DFW. Principle says \"<$400k in DFW = price shopping, low margin\". So that's a negative.\n\n4. Absentee: false, so not an issue.\n\n5. Missing data: All fields present, so no assumption of worst.\n\n6. Project description: Specific, but not for our trades.\n\nOverall, even if it were for a roofer, the low property value suggests price shopping. But it's not for a roofer.\n\nSo score 0.\n\nTier: F? But tiers are A, B, C. C is <50. So tier C.\n\nReasoning: This lead is for an HVAC replacement, which is not within the scope of the marketplace's premium contractors (pool, patio, roof, fence). Additionally, the low property value indicates a price-sensitive customer unlikely to pay premium rates.\n\nFlags: [\"Out of scope project\", \"Low property value\"]\n\nIdeal contractor: None among the marketplace buyers; an HVAC contractor would be appropriate.\n\nContact priority: skip (since not relevant)\n\nBut let's see if we should still consider it? Maybe the lead marketplace sometimes gets leads outside the scope and we need to score them based on potential for cross-sell? Unlikely.\n\nGiven the principles, I think score 0 is justified.\n\nI'll output accordingly.",

    "chain_of_thought": "We are scoring a lead for a luxury contractor lead marketplace. The lead is for a pool construction project. Let's break down the information:\n\n1. **Applicant Type**: The owner is \"RICCETTI, RICHARD\". The project description is \"Building a concrete swimming pool with decking\". There is no indication that this is a builder or LLC. It appears to be a homeowner (individual name). However, note: \"is_absentee\": true. That means the owner doesn't live at the property. But the applicant type seems to be a homeowner (doing their own permit). The principles say: \"Homeowner doing their own permit = gold (active buyer)\". So that's positive. But absentee adds context.\n\n2. **Freshness**: This is a pool lead. According to principles: \"Pool leads stay warm for 2 months\". The lead is only 3 days old, so very fresh. That's a positive.\n\n3. **Wealth**: Market value is $425,000. According to principles: \"<$400k in DFW = price shopping, low margin\". But this is $425k, which is just above $400k. The city is Irving (part of DFW area). So it's borderline. It's not in the $500-750k solid range, and not $1M+. So likely the homeowner is somewhat price sensitive. Since it's slightly above $400k, maybe not as bad as under $400k, but still likely to compare quotes and might haggle.\n\n4. **Absentee**: is_absentee = true. The property value is $425k, which is not high value (not $1M+). So principle: \"Absentee + low value = landlord, will choose cheapest\". So that's a concern. This might be a rental property, and the owner may be looking for the cheapest option.\n\n5. **Missing Data**: We have all data fields filled. So no missing data.\n\n6. **Project Description**: \"Building a concrete swimming pool with decking\" \u2013 this is specific and shows high intent for a pool. It's not vague. Concrete swimming pool indicates a permanent, quality pool. Decking is an additional upgrade. So the project seems well-defined.\n\nOther factors: The permit type is \"Swimming Pool/Spa\", which matches the description.\n\nNow, scoring: How quickly can a premium contractor monetize this lead? Given it's a pool lead, but the owner is absentee with a moderate property value, likely a landlord. Landlords are often cost-conscious and might not go for luxury/premium contractors. However, the project is specific and fresh. The applicant is the homeowner (though absentee), so they are the buyer. But because they are absentee, they might be harder to reach or less emotionally invested in quality.\n\nWe need to consider the ideal contractor: Pool builders. They would be interested in this lead. But the contractor would need to be competitive on price, not necessarily luxury.\n\nScore calibration: 90+ is call today, high close probability. This doesn't seem like that because of absentee and moderate value. 70-89 is strong lead, standard follow-up. Possibly in that range? 50-69 is worth working, needs qualification. 30-49 is low priority. <30 is flag for review.\n\nWe need to assign a score 0-100.\n\nLet's weigh the positives:\n- Homeowner doing own permit (gold) \u2013 but absentee modifies that.\n- Freshness: 3 days old, pool leads stay warm 2 months \u2013 very fresh.\n- Project description: specific, high intent.\n- Market value: $425k \u2013 not low, but not high. Borderline.\n\nNegatives:\n- Absentee with moderate value: likely landlord, will choose cheapest.\n- Not a high-value property, so willingness to pay for quality is lower.\n\nSo overall, this lead is probably in the B or C tier. Might be a B if the contractor can compete on price, but a premium contractor might struggle.\n\nThe principles say: \"Absentee + low value = landlord, will choose cheapest.\" Here value is $425k, which is not extremely low, but in DFW context, it's moderate. I'd say it's on the lower side for a luxury contractor. So likely price-sensitive.\n\nThus, the score should be in the 50-69 range (worth working, needs qualification) or maybe lower if we consider the absentee landlord aspect heavily.\n\nLet's think: A pool is a big-ticket item. A landlord might still invest in a pool to increase rental value, but they might not go for the highest-end contractor. However, concrete pool with decking is a quality project, so they might be willing to pay for durability.\n\nBut overall, the lead is not a slam dunk for a premium contractor. It might be monetizable quickly if the contractor is competitive, but not necessarily at a high margin.\n\nI'll score it around 60? That's B tier (50-79). But let's calculate more precisely based on principles.\n\nWe can break down:\n\nApplicant type: Homeowner doing permit \u2013 gold, but absentee. So maybe downgrade from gold to silver? The principle says homeowner = gold, but absentee contextual. So maybe 80% of gold? Not sure.\n\nFreshness: 3 days old, pool leads warm 2 months, so very fresh: positive, maybe 90.\n\nWealth: $425k, slightly above $400k threshold, but still in price-shopping range. So maybe 40.\n\nAbsentee: With this value, negative, maybe -20.\n\nProject description: Specific, high intent: positive, maybe +10.\n\nBut these are arbitrary.\n\nMaybe a score of 55-65.\n\nLet's decide: I'll go with 60.\n\nTier: B (since 60 is 50-79).\n\nReasoning: 2-3 sentences: \"Fresh lead with specific pool project, but absentee ownership and moderate property value suggest a landlord who may prioritize cost over quality. The lead is worth pursuing but will require competitive pricing and quick follow-up. Premium contractors may need to emphasize value and durability to close.\"\n\nFlags: [\"Absentee owner\", \"Moderate property value (likely landlord)\", \"Potential price sensitivity\"]\n\nIdeal contractor: \"Pool builder with mid-range pricing or ability to offer durable options at competitive rates.\"\n\nContact priority: \"call\" because it's fresh, but maybe not urgent? The principles say for pool leads, they stay warm for 2 months, so it's not an emergency. But still, freshness matters. Since it's a B lead, standard follow-up. The calibration for 60 is \"Worth working, needs qualification\". So contact priority could be \"call\" or \"email\"? The output says \"call\" | \"email\" | \"skip\". Probably \"call\" is appropriate for leads that need qualification. However, absentee might make calling harder. But we can still suggest call.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"email\" first? But the instruction says \"contact_priority\": \"call\" | \"email\" | \"skip\". For a B lead, typically call. But if absentee, maybe email is better? But we'll follow the calibration: 60 is worth working, so call.\n\nI'll put \"call\".\n\nLet's structure the output.",

    "chain_of_thought": "We need to score this lead. The lead is for a plumbing project. The buyers are pool builders, patio contractors, roofers, fence companies. This is a plumbing standalone permit. But note: our buyers are specific trades: pool, patio, roof, fence. Plumbing is not directly one of them. However, sometimes contractors might cross-sell or there might be overlap? But the instructions are for a luxury contractor lead marketplace for those specific trades. This lead is for plumbing. Possibly it's not a match? But we have to score based on how quickly a premium contractor can monetize this lead. But our buyers are not plumbers. Wait, maybe I misinterpreted: \"YOUR BUYERS: Pool builders, patio contractors, roofers, fence companies\" means that these are the types of contractors who buy leads from the marketplace. So the lead should be for those services. But this lead is for a plumbing permit. Perhaps it's a mistake? Or maybe the marketplace also includes other trades? The principles don't mention plumbing. But we have to score it anyway. Possibly the lead is for a bathroom remodel that might involve tile work, but it says \"Plumbing Standalone\" and the description is about replacing tub to shower, acrylic base and walls, fixture and valve. That sounds like a plumbing job, maybe also a bathroom contractor. But our buyers are pool, patio, roof, fence. So not a direct match. However, maybe some patio contractors do outdoor showers? Unlikely. Or pool builders might do plumbing? Possibly for pools, but this is indoor plumbing. So it's probably not a lead that our buyers would typically monetize. But we have to score it. Let's see the principles: \n\n1. APPLICANT TYPE MATTERS MOST: The owner name is \"BELL BEVERLY JANE\" which looks like a homeowner (individual). The permit type is plumbing standalone, likely pulled by a contractor? But the applicant might be the homeowner? The principle says: \"Homeowner doing their own permit = gold (active buyer)\". But here, the permit is plumbing standalone, and the owner is an individual. It might be that the homeowner pulled the permit themselves, or a contractor did. But the owner name is the homeowner, so likely the homeowner is the applicant? We need more info. But based on owner_name, it's an individual, not a company. So likely homeowner. No indication of builder. So applicant type is good.\n\n2. FRESHNESS: The lead is 3 days old. For plumbing, what category? It's not roof, pool, or the others. \"Everything else: 30 days is the line between warm and cool.\" So 3 days is very fresh.\n\n3. WEALTH: Property market value is $488,850. That is in the $500-750k range? Actually it's below $500k: $488,850. The principle says: \"$500-750k = solid, will compare 2-3 quotes\" and \"<$400k in DFW = price shopping, low margin\". This is $488k, which is between $400k and $500k. Not explicitly mentioned. Possibly it's in the lower end of solid. But note the city is Irving, which is in DFW area (Dallas-Fort Worth). So <$400k is price shopping. This is above $400k, but below $500k. Might be in a gray area. Possibly still solid but maybe more price-conscious.\n\n4. ABSENTEE: is_absentee is false, so owner lives there. That's good.\n\n5. MISSING DATA: We have all data: project description, owner name, market value, days old, absentee status, city. Nothing missing.\n\n6. PROJECT DESCRIPTION: \"Replace existing tub to shower with acrylic base and walls. Replace fixture and valve. Only working in wet space. No electrical work.\" This sounds like a specific bathroom remodel focused on plumbing. It's not vague. It shows clear intent. No indication of builder.\n\nNow, the biggest issue: This lead is for plumbing work. Our buyers are pool builders, patio contractors, roofers, fence companies. They don't do plumbing. So how can they monetize it? Possibly some contractors might have plumbing subcontractors or might offer bathroom remodels? But the listed trades are specific. Maybe the marketplace is for home improvement leads in general? But the instructions specify those trades. Perhaps we need to consider which of our buyers would be interested. Possibly none. But maybe patio contractors sometimes do outdoor plumbing? Unlikely. Or pool builders need plumbing for pools? This is indoor tub/shower. So it's not a match.\n\nIf it's not a match, then the score should be low because a premium contractor from our marketplace cannot monetize it quickly. The ideal contractor would be a plumber or bathroom remodeler, but they are not our buyers. So the lead is not suitable.\n\nBut wait, the principles don't say to filter out non-matching trades. They say \"Production builder in project_description = trash (should be filtered, score 0 if you see one)\". That's the only explicit filter. So maybe the marketplace does include other trades? Or maybe we are supposed to assume that the lead is for one of the trades? But the permit_type is \"Plumbing Standalone\". That's clearly not pool, patio, roof, or fence. Possibly it's a mistake in the test lead. We need to score based on the principles as given.\n\nMaybe we need to interpret the lead as potentially for a bathroom contractor, but our buyers don't include that. So the score should reflect that it's not a good lead for our buyers. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the marketplace is for luxury contractors in general, and the buyers listed are examples? But the instruction says \"YOUR BUYERS: Pool builders, patio contractors, roofers, fence companies\". So we are scoring for those specific buyers.\n\nThus, for a plumbing lead, the monetization potential for our buyers is near zero. So score should be very low.\n\nBut let's see the calibration: <30: \"Why did this pass the filter? Flag for review\". That seems appropriate.\n\nSo I'd score it low, maybe 10 or 20, because it's not relevant.\n\nBut let's go through the principles anyway, assuming it were for a relevant trade.\n\nIf this were for a roofer, for example, then:\n- Applicant: homeowner, good.\n- Freshness: 3 days old, for roof leads go stale in 2 weeks, so very fresh.\n- Wealth: $488k, solid but not top tier.\n- Absentee: false, good.\n- Description: specific.\n\nBut it's not a roof lead.\n\nIf it were for a pool builder, pool leads stay warm for 2 months, so 3 days is fresh. But the description is about a bathroom shower, not a pool.\n\nSo clearly, the lead is mismatched.\n\nTherefore, score should be low.\n\nBut maybe we need to consider that some contractors might cross-sell other trades? Principle 1 says: \"Custom/boutique builder = okay (cross-sell other trades)\". But this is a homeowner, not a builder.\n\nSo overall, I think the score should be low because it's not a lead for our buyers.\n\nLet's decide on a score. I'll go with 10.\n\nTier: C (since <50)\n\nReasoning: The lead is for plumbing work, which does not match the target buyer trades (pool, patio, roof, fence). Although the homeowner is likely a qualified buyer with a clear project, the mismatch means a premium contractor cannot monetize it.\n\nFlags: [\"Mismatched trade: plumbing\", \"Market value below $500k may indicate price sensitivity\"]\n\nIdeal contractor: Plumber or bathroom remodeler (not in our marketplace)\n\nContact priority: skip (since not relevant)\n\nBut wait, the output format includes \"ideal_contractor\" and \"contact_priority\". For ideal contractor, we should say who among our buyers might be closest? Possibly none. Or maybe a patio contractor could do outdoor showers? That's stretching. Better to say it's not a fit.\n\nMaybe we should say \"None - not a match for marketplace\"\n\nContact priority: skip.\n\nLet's see if there's any chance a pool builder might be interested? They do plumbing for pools, but indoor plumbing is different. Unlikely.\n\nSo final score: 10.\n\nBut let's double-check: The principle \"Missing data = assume the worst\" - we have data, so that's fine.\n\nAlso, the project description reveals truth: It's a specific plumbing job, no builder indication.\n\nSo I'll go with that.",

The score is based on \"How quickly can a premium contractor monetize this lead?\" \n\nWe need to apply the given principles.\n\nLet's analyze the lead:\n\n- project_description: \"Changeout of one(1) Condenser unit HVAC 3Ton\" \u2192 This is an HVAC project, not directly related to the listed contractors (pool, patio, roof, fence). However, note that the permit type is \"Mechanical Standalone\". This might be for an HVAC contractor, but our marketplace is for luxury contractors in specific trades. Possibly this lead is not for our typical contractors. But we are asked to score it anyway. Perhaps we need to consider if any of our contractors also do HVAC? Unlikely. So this lead might be off-target. But the principles mention \"production builder in project_description = trash\", but here it's an HVAC replacement. The lead might be mis-categorized. However, we should score based on the given principles.\n\n- permit_type: \"Mechanical Standalone\" \u2192 This suggests it's an HVAC permit.\n\n- owner_name: \"ZENITH D&G LLC\" \u2192 This is an LLC, so applicant type is LLC/investor. According to principle 1: LLC/investor = depends on property value.\n\n- market_value: 269710.0 \u2192 This is below $400k. In DFW (Irving is in DFW area), property value <$400k means price shopping, low margin (principle 3).\n\n- days_old: 3 \u2192 Fresh lead.\n\n- is_absentee: true \u2192 Owner is absentee. Combined with low property value ($269k), according to principle 4: Absentee + low value = landlord, will choose cheapest.\n\n- city: \"irving\" \u2192 Part of Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex.\n\nNow, apply principles:\n\n1. Applicant type: LLC/investor. Property value is low, so likely a landlord looking for cheapest option. Not a high-quality lead for a premium contractor.\n\n2. Freshness: The lead is 3 days old, so fresh. But the category? The project is HVAC, not one of the specified categories (pool, patio, roof, fence). However, we might consider it under \"everything else\" for freshness? Actually, the principle says: \"Roof leads go stale in 2 weeks, Pool leads stay warm for 2 months, Everything else: 30 days is the line.\" So for this lead, since it's not roof or pool, it's \"everything else\", and 3 days is fresh. But freshness alone doesn't make it a good lead.\n\n3. Wealth: Property value $269,710 is <$400k, so price shopping, low margin. Not willing to pay for quality.\n\n4. Absentee: true, low value, so landlord, will choose cheapest.\n\n5. Missing data: We have all data, but note: owner_name is LLC, so we can contact but likely a business. Not a homeowner.\n\n6. Project description: It's specific about the work: \"Changeout of one(1) Condenser unit HVAC 3Ton\". That's clear intent, but for HVAC, not for our contractors' trades.\n\nGiven that our marketplace is for luxury contractors in pool, patio, roof, fence, this lead is for HVAC. So a premium contractor in our marketplace would not be interested. Therefore, the lead should score low because it cannot be monetized quickly (or at all) by our target contractors. Possibly we should treat it as irrelevant.\n\nBut the instructions say \"Score 0-100 based on: How quickly can a premium contractor monetize this lead?\" Our premium contractors are pool builders, patio contractors, roofers, fence companies. They don't do HVAC. So they can't monetize it. Score should be very low.\n\nAlso, principle 1 says: \"Production builder in project_description = trash (score 0 if you see one)\". But here there's no production builder mentioned. However, the owner is an LLC and the project is HVAC replacement. This might be a maintenance item for a rental property. It's not a luxury project.\n\nConsidering calibration: <30: \"Why did this pass the filter? Flag for review\". This lead likely passed the filter because maybe the filter isn't perfect. It's an HVAC permit, not a luxury home improvement project.\n\nThus, score low.\n\nLet's determine tier and reasoning.\n\nScore: I'll give a score of 10. Because there is some information, but it's not suitable for our contractors.\n\nReasoning: The lead is for an HVAC replacement, which is not a service offered by the premium contractors in our marketplace (pool, patio, roof, fence). Additionally, the property value is low and the owner is an absentee LLC, indicating a landlord likely seeking the lowest cost option, not a premium contractor.\n\nFlags: [\"HVAC project not relevant to marketplace\", \"Low property value\", \"Absentee LLC landlord\", \"Likely price-sensitive\"]\n\nIdeal contractor: This lead would be suitable for an HVAC contractor, but not for our target luxury contractors.

    "chain_of_thought": "We are given a lead to score. Let's analyze based on the principles.\n\nFirst, check applicant type. The owner name is \"DIXON TERRIE L\" which looks like a homeowner (personal name). The project description is \"reroof shingles only\" which seems like a homeowner's roof replacement. There's no indication of a builder or LLC. So likely homeowner.\n\nSecond, freshness: This is a roof lead, which goes stale in 2 weeks. Days old is 3, so very fresh. Good.\n\nThird, wealth: Market value is $290,000. According to principle 3: <$400k in DFW = price shopping, low margin. The city is Irving, which is in the DFW area. So this is a lower-value property, likely price-sensitive.\n\nFourth, absentee: is_absentee is false, so owner-occupied. That's generally better than absentee for low-value because they might care more about quality? But with low value, still likely price shopping.\n\nFifth, missing data: We have market value, owner name, etc. No missing data.\n\nSixth, project description: \"reroof shingles only\" indicates a specific roof job, but it's a basic re-roof. Might be a straightforward job but possibly lower budget.\n\nNow, putting it together: This is a roof lead, very fresh (3 days old), but property value is low ($290k). According to the principles, roof leads are emergency purchases and go stale quickly. However, the low property value suggests the homeowner is likely price-sensitive and will shop around. Willingness to pay for quality is lower. For a premium contractor, this might not be the ideal high-margin lead.\n\nScoring: We need to score based on \"How quickly can a premium contractor monetize this lead?\" For roof leads, freshness is key, but wealth matters. A low property value means they might be looking for the cheapest option, not necessarily premium work. So monetization might be harder, lower margin, possibly more competition.\n\nLet's think of tiers: \n- A tier (80+): high close probability, high margin.\n- B tier (50-79): solid lead, worth working.\n- C tier (<50): low priority.\n\nThis lead is fresh, but with low property value, it's likely a price shopper. So it might be a B or C.\n\nConsider calibration: \n- 90+: call today, high close probability.\n- 70-89: strong lead, standard follow-up.\n- 50-69: worth working, needs qualification.\n- 30-49: low priority, batch outreach only.\n- <30: flag for review.\n\nI'd place this in the 40-60 range. Maybe around 50? Let's break down:\n\nPositive: \n- Homeowner (good applicant type)\n- Fresh (3 days old, roof lead, so very fresh)\n- Specific project description (reroof shingles only)\n\nNegative:\n- Low property value ($290k) indicates price sensitivity, low margin potential.\n- In DFW, <$400k is price shopping.\n\nFor a premium contractor, monetizing quickly might be challenging because the homeowner may not be willing to pay premium prices. However, roof leads are urgent, so they might decide quickly, but they'll likely get multiple quotes and choose the cheapest. So the contractor might have to compete on price.\n\nScore: I'll go with 55. It's worth working but needs qualification to see if they are actually looking for quality or just cheapest.\n\nFlags: Low property value, price-sensitive market.\n\nIdeal contractor: A roofer who does efficient, mid-range work (not necessarily luxury, but could be a premium contractor who can adjust pricing? Actually, the marketplace is for luxury contractors, so maybe not ideal. The ideal contractor might be a roofer who can offer competitive pricing but still quality. But the principle says \"premium contractor\", so we need to consider if a premium contractor can monetize quickly. Probably not the best fit for a high-end roofer, but maybe a roofer with good conversion skills.)\n\nContact priority: Since it's a roof lead and fresh, calling is important because roof leads go stale fast. Even if it's lower value, calling quickly might get the job if they haven't gotten quotes yet. So I'd say \"call\".\n\nLet's structure output.\n\n{\n  \"score\": 55,\n  \"tier\": \"B\",\n  \"reasoning\": \"Fresh roof lead with clear intent, but low property value suggests price sensitivity and lower margin potential for a premium contractor.\",\n  \"flags\": [\"Low property value (<$400k in DFW)\", \"May be price shopping\"],\n  \"ideal_contractor\": \"Roofing contractor with efficient operations and competitive pricing, able to convert quickly.\",\n  \"contact_priority\": \"call\"\n}\n\nBut wait, the tier B is 50-79, so 55 is B. Reasonable.\n\nDouble-check: Is there any reason to score lower? Maybe because it's a basic \"shingles only\" job, not a high-end roof? Possibly. But still, it's a specific job. I think 55 is okay.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 50 exactly. But let's not overthink.\n\nI'll go with 55.",

    "chain_of_thought": "We are scoring a lead for a luxury contractor marketplace. The lead is for an accessory structure (gazebo) installation on a property with high market value ($1,013,000). The owners appear to be individuals (WANG YINING & QUANQUAN LIU), not a company. The project description is specific: \"To permanently install a Yardistry 10' x 10' Gazebo on an installed paver in our outside backyard.\" The lead is fresh (3 days old), not absentee, and in Irving.\n\nLet's apply the principles:\n\n1. Applicant Type: The owner name looks personal (two individuals), and the project description mentions \"our outside backyard,\" indicating homeowners doing their own permit. This is gold (active buyer). No indication of being a builder.\n\n2. Freshness: The project is an accessory structure, which might fall under \"everything else\" (not roof, not pool). Freshness guideline: 30 days is the line; this is only 3 days old, so very fresh.\n\n3. Wealth: Property value is $1,013,000, which is over $1M. According to principles: \"$1M+ property = pays for quality, doesn't haggle.\" High willingness to pay.\n\n4. Absentee: is_absentee is false, so not an issue. Even if absentee, with high value it could be vacation home, but here it's owner-occupied.\n\n5. Missing Data: We have owner name, market value, project description, etc. No missing data that would raise concerns.\n\n6. Project Description: Specific and clear: installing a Yardistry gazebo permanently on pavers. Shows high intent and specificity. No red flags like builder names.\n\nNow, consider the type of contractor: This is for an accessory structure (gazebo). Which contractor category would this fit? Possibly patio contractors (since it involves outdoor structure installation on pavers) or fence companies (some might do gazebos). Pool builders likely not. Roofers not. But the lead marketplace includes patio contractors. The project is a gazebo installation, which could be considered a patio/outdoor living project. So ideal contractor might be a patio contractor or a specialized gazebo installer.\n\nScoring: Based on principles, this is a high-quality lead: homeowner, high property value, specific project, fresh. It should score high.\n\nWhat tier? Likely A (80+). Let's calibrate: 90+ is call today, high close probability. This seems like a strong candidate for 90+ because:\n- High intent homeowner with a clear project.\n- Wealthy, likely to pay for quality.\n- Fresh lead.\n\nPotential concerns? None major. The only minor flag is that the project is a gazebo, which might be a smaller project compared to a full patio or pool, but still premium. But the principles don't mention project size; they focus on monetization speed. A high-end homeowner wanting a permanent installation likely will pay well and not haggle, so a contractor can monetize quickly.\n\nFlags: None significant. Maybe check that it's not a DIY project? But they are pulling a permit, so likely hiring. \"Permanently install\" suggests they want professional installation.\n\nIdeal contractor: Patio contractor or outdoor living specialist.\n\nContact priority: call today (score >90).\n\nLet's assign a score: I'd say 92.\n\nReasoning: \"Homeowners with a specific, high-end gazebo installation project on a $1M+ property. Fresh lead with clear intent, indicating quick monetization potential for a patio contractor.\"\n\nFlags: none, maybe an empty list or mention that it's a smaller project? But with high value, it's still good.\n\nLet's structure output.\n\nOutput format:\n{\n  \"score\": 92,\n  \"tier\": \"A\",\n  \"reasoning\": \"Homeowner-led permit for a specific luxury gazebo installation on a high-value property. Lead is only 3 days old, and wealthy clients typically convert quickly with minimal price negotiation.\",\n  \"flags\": [],\n  \"ideal_contractor\": \"Patio contractor or outdoor living specialist experienced with permanent structures and high-end clients.\",\n  \"contact_priority\": \"call\"\n}\n\nBut wait, the principles mention \"Roof leads go stale in 2 weeks, Pool leads 2 months, everything else 30 days.\" So this is very fresh. Also, the project is not emergency, but still likely a desired improvement.\n\nI think that's accurate.",

    "chain_of_thought": "We are scoring a lead for a luxury contractor marketplace. The lead is for a roof permit. We need to assess how quickly a premium contractor can monetize this lead based on the given principles.\n\nLet's evaluate each aspect:\n\n1. **Applicant Type**: The owner name is \"NARALA RAMA KRISHA &\" which appears to be an individual's name (possibly a family). There is no indication of a company or builder in the project description. The project description is about roof work. So likely a homeowner. This is good.\n\n2. **Freshness**: This is a roof lead. According to the principles, roof leads go stale in 2 weeks (emergency purchase). This lead is only 3 days old, so it's very fresh. That's a positive.\n\n3. **Wealth**: The property market value is $823,620, which is above $1M? Actually it's $823,620, which is in the $750k-$1M range? The principles say: $1M+ property = pays for quality; $500-750k = solid; <$400k = price shopping. This is $823,620, so it's between $750k and $1M. That's likely still solid, possibly high-end. The principle says $1M+ pays for quality, but this is close. We can consider it as high-value, likely willing to pay for quality.\n\n4. **Absentee**: is_absentee is false, so the owner lives there. That's good; they are likely invested in quality.\n\n5. **Missing Data**: We have all data: project description, permit type, owner name, market value, days old, is_absentee, city. Nothing missing.\n\n6. **Project Description**: \"Remove and replace shingles, repair damaged roof decking as necessary\". This is specific roof work, high intent. No red flags like builder name.\n\nAdditional considerations:\n- The permit type is \"Roof\", so it's a roof lead. Roof leads are time-sensitive.\n- City is Irving, which is in DFW area? Possibly. The principle mentions DFW for low-value properties, but this property is high value.\n\nNow scoring:\n- Applicant type: Homeowner, so gold. + points.\n- Freshness: 3 days old for a roof lead, very fresh. + points.\n- Wealth: $823,620 is high, likely willing to pay for quality. + points.\n- Absentee: false, so owner-occupied. + points.\n- Project description: Specific roof work. + points.\n\nPotential flags: None obvious. The owner name might be a bit unusual but not a concern.\n\nIdeal contractor: Roofer, specifically a premium roofer who does quality work.\n\nContact priority: Since it's a roof lead and fresh, it should be called quickly. Roof leads are emergency purchases, so call today.\n\nScore: Let's calibrate. This seems like a strong lead. Possibly 90+? But let's see: The property is not over $1M, but close. It's a homeowner, specific project, fresh. I'd say it's an A tier, maybe around 85-90. But since it's a roof lead and very fresh, it could be 90+. However, the principles say $1M+ pays for quality, doesn't haggle. This is $823k, so they might still compare 2-3 quotes. So it's not the absolute top, but still very good.\n\nGiven the calibration: 90+ is call today, high close probability. This is definitely call today. So score could be 90 or above.\n\nLet's break down:\n- Applicant type: homeowner = gold, so maybe 25 out of 25?\n- Freshness: 3 days for roof = 25 out of 25? (roof goes stale in 2 weeks, so 3 days is excellent)\n- Wealth: $823k = maybe 20 out of 25? (since not $1M+ but still high)\n- Absentee: false = 10 out of 10?\n- Project description: specific = 10 out of 10?\nMaybe total = 90? Actually that sums to 90. But also consider that roof leads are emergency, so maybe bonus? I think 90 is reasonable.\n\nBut wait: The principles say \"Production builder in project_description = trash\". Not applicable here. So no negative.\n\nFlags: None? Maybe check if the owner name might indicate an LLC? \"NARALA RAMA KRISHA &\" the ampersand might indicate multiple owners, but likely a family. Not a company.\n\nIdeal contractor: \"Premium roofer specializing in high-end residential\"\n\nContact priority: \"call\" (today)\n\nTier: A (80+)\n\nReasoning: Homeowner with a specific roof repair need on a high-value property, lead is very fresh (3 days) which is critical for roof emergencies.\n\nSo output:\n\n{\n  \"score\": 90,\n  \"tier\": \"A\",\n  \"reasoning\": \"Homeowner with high-value property ($823k) seeking roof replacement; lead is only 3 days old, which is critical for time-sensitive roof work.

Maybe 92? But 90 is fine. Let's see if there is any reason to deduct: The market value is not over $1M, so maybe not the absolute top willingness to pay. But still solid. I'll keep at 90.",
