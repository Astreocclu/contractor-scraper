Jimbo stayed on top of everything on the whole job, from the initial inspection through the final cleanup. He also came over when the insurance company sent an inspector over.

I've seen them around neighborhoods while driving around and I finally had a leaky roof. I called them, they came out right away. Astar was very clear about the issues I had, showed me photos and detailed why I had a leak. Offered me several options for how to fix it, I wanted to replace the plastic bits on my roof anyway because I have a new house and it pissed me off the builders went cheap on me.

We were in regular communication so we knew what was going on. They worked with our insurance company to help us get the work done. They even swept up all the leaves on our walkways and porch (we are in no physical condition to do that). Everything is better than it was before. I highly recommend A Star Roofing of Texas!", "rating": 5, "date": "2 months ago", "reviewer_name": "Janice Schwarz", "source": "google_maps"}], "source": "google_maps"}}
