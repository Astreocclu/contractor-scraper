# Legacy Decommissioned Code

This folder contains old JavaScript scrapers that have been replaced by Python/Playwright versions.

## Why Decommissioned

- **js-scrapers/**: Original Node.js scrapers using Puppeteer. Replaced by Python scrapers using Playwright which is more reliable and has better anti-detection capabilities.

## DO NOT USE

These files are kept for reference only. The active scrapers are in `/scrapers/*.py`.
